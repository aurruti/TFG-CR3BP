# Code Base: Study and optimization of transfer orbits to the L4 and L5 Lagrange Points of the Earth-Sun system

The Circular-Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) describes the motion of a small celestial body in the gravitational field of two larger bodies. The present study focuses on the application of the CR3BP to the Sun-Earth system. To that end, the governing and defining equations for the CR3BP are described in-depth; and key periodic orbits around the Lagrange Points L1, L2, L4, and L5 are mapped. These last two points, located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle in the rotating frame of reference, are particularly useful for observation and exploration due to their stability. Thus, the L4 and L5 points are the final objective of the present study. The study focuses on optimizing transfer trajectories from the previously mapped orbits around L1 and L2 to orbits around L4 and L5, respectively. The procedures utilized significantly reduce the required delta-V budget to perform these transfers to approximately 3 km/s, a value lower than the minimum requirements for interplanetary transfers departing from Earth. This finding has the potential to open up new opportunities for asteroid science and solar observation based at the equilateral Lagrange Points of the Sun-Earth system; ultimately contributing to advancing the current era of scientific research in the field of astrodynamics.


This repository includes de full codebase required for the optmization of such transfer orbits; and is ultimately part of the Bachelor's Final Thesis on the topic, directed by Adrià Rovira (gAGE - UPC) and Ariadna Farrés (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center). The thesis ultimately represented the culmitation of the studies of the B.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC); and it is also available as an academic publication at: http://hdl.handle.net/2117/384831


Full documentation on the code usage can be found in Appendix A of the thesis (PDF); and, to a lesser extent in the GitHub wiki ( https://github.com/aurruti/TFG-CR3BP/wiki )
